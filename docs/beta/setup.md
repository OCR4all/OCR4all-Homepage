If you want to try out the beta version of release 1.0 of OCR4all you can simply use the following Docker Compose file or download it [here]().

The prerequisite for this is having both [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed. 

A more in-depth installation guide will follow with the stable release of OCR4all 1.0.
