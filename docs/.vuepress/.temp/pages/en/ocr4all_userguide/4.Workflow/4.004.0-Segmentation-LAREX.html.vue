<p><strong>Input:</strong> pre-processed images<br>
<strong>Output:</strong> structural information about the layout regions (type and position) as well as reading order</p>
<p>LAREX is a segmentation tool which structures and classifies a printed page’s layout with regard to its later processing. LAREX is based on the basic assumption that the pages of early modern prints are composed of a recurring array of layout elements whose composition, although always book-specific, is largely consistent. Thus, the user is provided with different tools and resources whose aim it is to adequately structure and segment a printed page in order to catalogue all layout-related information necessary to the workflow’s subsequent steps. Besides the basic distinction between text and non-text (e.g. text vs. image/woodcut) and its further specifications (e.g. text headline, main text, page number etc.), this also includes information about the page’s reading order, i.e. the reading and usage order of the available layout elements.</p>
