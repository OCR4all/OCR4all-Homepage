<p><strong>Input:</strong> polluted binarized images<br>
<strong>Output:</strong> binarized images without (or with very little) pollution</p>
<p>-The noise removal option helps to get rid of small impurities such as stains or blotches on the scans</p>
<ul>
<li>Proceed by clicking on ‘noise removal’ (main menu) and selecting the scans you wish to process on the right side of your display. You should initially conserve the default settings and, after clicking on ‘execute’, check the initial quality of the results: simply click on the designation of the scan you wish to verify (right sidebar); the ‘image preview’ option will provide you with a side by side comparison of the image before and after the noise removal. Please note that red elements will be deleted by this step.</li>
</ul>
