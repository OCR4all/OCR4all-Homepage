Thus, the user is provided with different tools and resources whose aim it is to adequately structure and segment a printed page in order to catalogue all layout-related information necessary to the workflow’s subsequent steps. Besides the basic distinction between text and non-text (e.g. text vs. image/woodcut) and its further specifications (e.g. text headline, main text, page number etc.), this also includes information about the page’s reading order, i.e. the reading and usage order of the available layout elements.")])])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=o.exports}}]);
