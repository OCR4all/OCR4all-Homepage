## Motivation and General Idea
- **Availability of Solutions:** Numerous high-performance open-source solutions for ATR are already available, with new releases emerging continuously.
- **Diverse Use Cases:** The highly heterogeneous nature of use cases necessitates the targeted deployment of specialized ATR solutions.
- **Requirement:** There is a need for user-friendly frameworks that facilitate the flexible, integrable, and sustainable combination and application of both existing and future ATR solutions.
- **Objective:** Our goal is to empower users to perform ATR independently, achieving high-quality results.
- **Foundation:** This framework is built upon freely available tools, enhanced by our in-house developments.

## OCR-D and OCR4all
- **OCR-D Initiative:** The DFG-funded OCR-D initiative is dedicated to facilitating the mass full-text transformation of historical prints published in the German-speaking world.
- **Focus Areas:** OCR-D emphasizes interoperability and connectivity, ensuring a high degree of flexibility and sustainability in its solutions.
- **Integrated Solutions:** The initiative combines multiple ATR solutions within a unified framework, enabling precise adaptation to specific materials and use cases.
- **Open Source Commitment:** All results from the OCR-D project are released as completely open-source.
- **OCR4all-Libraries Project:** The DFG-funded OCR4all-libraries project has two primary goals:
    - Providing a user-friendly interface for OCR-D solutions via OCR4all, enabling independent use by non-technical users.
    - Enhancing the ATR output within OCR4all to offer added value to even the most technically experienced users.

## System Architecture
- **Modularity and Interoperability:** The framework is designed with a strong focus on modularity and interoperability, ensuring seamless integration and adaptability.
- **Distributed Infrastructure:** The architecture features a distributed infrastructure, with a clear separation between the backend and frontend components.
    - **Backend:** Built with Java and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).
    - **Frontend:** Developed using the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) ecosystem.
- **Component Communication:** Components communicate via a REST API, enabling efficient interaction between different parts of the system.
- **Integration of Third-Party Solutions:** Service Provider Interfaces (SPIs) allow for the integration of third-party solutions, such as ATR processors.
- **Containerized Setup:** The containerized architecture ensures easy distribution and deployment of all integrated components with minimal barriers.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Users retain full control over their data, with no data leaving the instance without explicit user or administrator consent.
- **Reproducibility:** Every step in the process is fully reproducible. A "transcript of records" feature stores detailed information about the processors and parameters used, ensuring transparency and repeatability.

## Modules

### Data Management and Processing
- **Separation of Functions:** Data management and processing are strictly separated to ensure efficient handling and security.
- **Data Sharing:** Data can be shared with different users or user groups as needed.

### Processors and NodeFlow
- **Wide Array of Processors:** A diverse range of ATR processors is available, including OCR-D and external options.
- **Ease of Integration:** New processors can be easily implemented via a well-defined interface, with the user interface generated automatically.
- **NodeFlow:** The graphical editor NodeFlow simplifies the creation of workflows, making it convenient for users to design and customize processing sequences.

### LAREX
- **Result Correction and Training Data Creation:** LAREX allows for the correction of all ATR workflow results and the creation of training data.
- **Visual Workflow Identification:** LAREX helps users identify the most suitable workflows as a visual explanation component.

### Datasets, Training, and Evaluation
- **Dataset Creation:** Datasets can be created with the option to use tagging and import functionalities.
- **Dataset Enrichment:** Datasets can be enriched with training data generated and tagged within the application, even across various projects and sources.
- **Model Training:** Train models on selected datasets or subsets thereof, with options for in-app usage or exporting both models and associated training data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate both trained and imported models using curated datasets to ensure quality and accuracy.

#### Flawless Transcription of Source Material
- **Objective:** Achieve maximum quality, accepting significant manual effort.
- **Users:** Humanist researchers preparing text for a digital edition.
- **Approach:** Utilize the base mode for iterative transcription with continually improving accuracy.

#### Building Corpora for Quantitative Applications
- **Objective:** Maximize quality while minimizing manual effort.
- **Users:** Researchers constructing corpora for training and evaluating quantitative methods.
- **Approach:** Manage data and consistently retrain source-specific or mixed models using datasets and tagging functionalities.
