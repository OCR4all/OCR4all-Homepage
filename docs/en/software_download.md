Latest version: OCR4all 0.5.0. With the release of OCR4all 0.5.0 in
	November of 2020, the software now offers not only the setup via Docker
	but also the option of installation via **VirtualBox**,
	which is particularly recommended for non-technical users. In addition,
	there are several new features such as the processing of greyscale
	images in LAREX, a collection of pre-configured virtual keyboards for
	different languages, the creation of structural data on the word level
	during text recognition and its integration into the corresponding
	PageXML files as well as extended selection options in Text Result
	Generation. Further bug fixes and enhancements can be found in the
	corresponding release notes of [OCR4all](https://github.com/OCR4all/OCR4all/releases)
    and [LAREX](https://github.com/OCR4all/LAREX/releases).
