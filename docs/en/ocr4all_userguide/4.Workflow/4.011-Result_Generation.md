Abb. 42: Result Generation.

- Once the user considers all recognition and correction steps to be finalized, results can be generated as TXT or XML files, saved under ocr4all/data/results.
- You can choose whether you need a text or PageXML file under 'settings'. If you opt for a text file, individual TXT files will be generated for each scan as well as an additional one containing your document's entire text.
- PageXML files are also generated on a page-base and additionally contain data about creation date, last changes in the file, metadata about each page's corresponding scan, about the page's size, its layout regions and their exact coordinates, its reading order, its text lines and their text content.
