### 4.10	Post Correction

**Input:** segmentation information and metadata on pre-processed scans, as well as the corresponding text
**Output:** corrected/improved segmentation info and text
Under menu item 'post correction', users will be able to manually adjust and correct all segmentation info and text generated through the course of the previous sub-modules. This sub-module is itself divided into three levels:
- The item 'segment' (i.e. level 1) will enable you to adjust all regions determined during segmentation and their reading order, page after page. You will recognize a few of the tools from working with LAREX (see above). Please note that all changes undertaken at this level will have consequences for the following levels. For example, if you decide to delete a certain region during level 1, you will loose all text lines belonging to this region going forward.
- The 'lines' item (i.e. level 2) enables you to manually adjust automatic line recognition. You will be able to add lines where there were none, to change their shape or position, or to delete them. The reading order can be adjusted as well, on a line basis.

- Under item 'text' (i.e. level 3), you will find the afore-described ground truth sub- module, in which the text content of your lines can be corrected once more.
