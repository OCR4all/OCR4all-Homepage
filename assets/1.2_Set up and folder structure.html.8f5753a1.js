In order to complete the structure, \u2018data\u2019 must contain a title folder, whose name can be freely chosen (whereby umlauts and blanks should be avoided) and which itself contains another subfolder titled \u2018input\u2019 in which the original scans or images must be deposited. As the OCR4all workflow progresses, a \u2018processing\u2019 folder will be automatically generated on the same system level, to which images corresponding to the processing stages of the user\u2019s scans and PageXML-files will be added.</p><p>Additionally, the user can save mixed recognition models in the \u2018models\u2019 folder (you will find a selection here). This folder will also contain book-specific models generated with OCR4all, which will be saved in sub folders named after the relevant book/work titles. Once a particular training starts, the generated models will be saved in such \u2018models/work title\u2019 folders and numbered accordingly, starting with \u20180\u2019.</p></p>',3);function r(l,o){return s}var i=e(a,[["render",r],["__file","1.2_Set up and folder structure.html.vue"]]);export{i as default};
