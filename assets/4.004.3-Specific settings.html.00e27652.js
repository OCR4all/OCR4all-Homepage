This assigning task must be consistently performed throughout the entire work, in preparation for further steps as well as for the actual recognition of the displayed content! Besides a small number of pre-set and predefined layout regions \u2013 for instance \u2018image\u2019 (graphics such as woodcuts and ornate initials), \u2018paragraph\u2019 (main text) or \u2018page_number\u2019 \u2013 the user can define and add further book-specific layout regions under \u2018create\u2019. Not only can the user change a region\u2019s colour, but they can also define the minimum size of a textual/graphical page element which they wish to recognize as such (under \u2018minSize\u2019). The layout region thus defined can be added to the book-specific list by clicking on \u2018save\u2019.</li></ul><pre>

Provided a page\u2019s layout is repeated throughout the entire book, the user can generate something of a layout template in order to improve segmentation and reduce the number of necessary corrections later on. In order to adjust the position of these layout regions to a book\u2019s specific layout, simply display the layout region\u2019s current position and adjust it by selecting the scanned page\u2019s regions.</li></ul><pre>

</pre><p>fig. 18. Defining new layout regions.</p><p>All things considered, it isn\u2019t always advisable to assign fixed positions to all layout regions for an entire book; if the position of certain regions such as chapter titles, mottos, page number or signature marks on the different pages is inconsistent, assigning predefined positions will lead to recognition errors. In this case, manually verifying and correcting these layout elements afterwards is the more practical approach. If the user needs to delete a layout region\u2019s position, they can simply select the region in question and press the \u2018delete\u2019 key.</p><ul><li>&#39;<strong>Parameters</strong>&#39;: Allows to define overall parameters of image and text recognition. Taking the time to pre-set certain book-specific parameters is recommended when working with an inconsistent layout, particularly that of early modern prints. These often feature great divergences of word and line spacing. To avoid a narrowly spaced group of lines from being recognised as one cohesive textual element, the \u2018text dilation\u2019 feature enables you to control and define the text\u2019s degree of dilation in the x- and y-direction. This will enable the software to recognise originally too close word/line spacing or to recognise widely spaced passages as one cohesive element. We recommend trying and testing in order to find the settings best suited to a particular book.</li></ul><pre>

Saving will generate an XML file which you will need to select when loading the settings (click on \u2018load settings\u2019, a new window will open; select file in question and open it). An additional feature will enable you to re-load previous pages\u2019 segmentation results if you wish to view them again: simply go to \u2018advanced settings\u2019 and click on \u2018load now\u2019. This will load any previously saved XML file containing that page\u2019s segmentation results.</li></ul><pre>

This can be done automatically provided a book\u2019s layout be relatively clear and simple. However, should you be working with a more complex layout structure, we recommend you proceed manually. Simply select \u2018auto generate a reading order\u2019 or \u2018set a reading order\u2019 under toolbar item \u2018Order\u2019.</li></ul><pre>

On the other hand, if you wish to manually establish reading order, you will need to click on each of the page\u2019s textual elements, in the correct order (see below), after which this reading order will appear in the aforementioned list. All elements of the reading order can be rearranged with a drag-and-drop or deleted by clicking on the corresponding recycle bin icon. As with everything in LAREX, the reading order can always be changed before saving the final segmentation results.</p>`,21);function o(a,r){return i}var l=e(n,[["render",o],["__file","4.004.3-Specific settings.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
