You will recognize a few of the tools from working with LAREX (see above). Please note that all changes undertaken at this level will have consequences for the following levels. For example, if you decide to delete a certain region during level 1, you will loose all text lines belonging to this region going forward.</li><li>The &#39;lines&#39; item (i.e. level 2) enables you to manually adjust automatic line recognition. You will be able to add lines where there were none, to change their shape or position, or to delete them. The reading order can be adjusted as well, on a line basis.</li></ul><pre>
