The following, exemplary segmentation process uses page 4 of reference book Cirurgia, which you can download here when downloading the OCR4all folder structure.</p><p><strong>Error analysis:</strong> Which layout elements were correctly recognised, which incorrectly, which weren\u2019t at all? Are there any user marks in the margins, bordures, spots or elements of text which will influence segmentation, but you wish to avoid being recognised?</p><pre>

To do so, go to toolbar and click on \u2018Set the region of interest\u2019 (under \u2018RoI\u2019), then use left click-and-hold to draw a rectangle around the page section you wish to segment.</p><pre>

</pre><p>fig. 23. Defining a &#39;region of interest&#39;.</p><p>Once RoI has been defined, click on &#39;SEGMENT&#39; button (right sidebar) \u2013 all element situated outside of RoI are now excluded from any further steps. Once RoI has been defined, it will be automatically transposed to all the book&#39;s scans. However, due to a wide array of factors, the page sections relevant to segmentation can shift from scan to scan. Therefore, as processing progresses, the user will likely need to adjust RoI from time to time. To do so, simply click on any RoI section and shift it using the mouse. Independently of RoI, the &#39;Create an ignore rectangle&#39; option creates an &#39;ignore region&#39; which allows for certain, small sections of a scan to be ignored and thus excluded from segmentation.</p><p><strong>Correcting layout recognition flaws:</strong> Incorrectly recognized layout elements can be assigned a new typification manually: a right- hand click on said element will open a pop-up menu from which you can choose the correct designation.</p><pre>

Correcting a faulty typification.</p><p>Should you need to separate a title from another textual element with which it is fused, there three ways to proceed: To begin, you can draw a rectangle around the section you wish to classify: proceed to toolbar, click on \u2018Segment\u2019 and select \u2018Create a fixed segment rectangle\u2019 (shortcut: 3); using mouse, draw a rectangle around the relevant section \u2013 a pop-up menu will appear from</p><p>which it\u2019s correct designation/type can be chosen. Next, you can instead choose to use a polygon shape. This option is particularly suited to the more complex or chaotic layouts and/ or those comprising angled edges, rounded pictures and woodcuts, or ornate initials inside the text block. Proceed to toolbar, click on \u2018Segment\u2019, this time selecting \u2018Create a fixed segment polygon\u2019 option (shortcut: 4). Using the mouse, generate a dotted line to go around end encompass the entire relevant section \u2013 once the line\u2019s end has been joined to its starting point, creating a polygon, the aforementioned pop-up menu will appear to allow for designation. Finally, you can also separate a text block \u2013 Initially recognized as one paragraph \u2013 into a title and main text using a cutting line: simply go to toolbar and \u2018Segment\u2019, and select \u2018Create a cut line\u2019 option (shortcut: 5).</p><pre>
