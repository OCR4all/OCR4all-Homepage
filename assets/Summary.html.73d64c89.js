Workflow</h2><p>In general, OCR4all provides two different versions of an OCR workflow. They are widely different, particularly when it comes to the workload they require and, inevitably, the verifiability of partial outcomes and subsequent quality of the generated data. Both will be outlined and categorized in the following.</p><h3 id="_4-1process-flow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-1process-flow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4.1 Process Flow</h3><p>This variant (main menu \u2630 \u2192 Process Flow) allows for a virtually automated workflow. It merely requires the initial pick of the intended scans (sidebar on the right) and subsequent selection of the individual processing steps the user wishes to apply to the chosen data (fig. 5).</p><p><img src="'+n+'" alt="Abb6.png"></p><p>fig. 6. &#39;Process flow&#39; Subcomponents.</p><p>In order to complete the process, choose an appropriate OCR model (or model package, composed of five individual models working simultaneously and in concert \u2013 see chapter 4.7). Simply go to \u2018setting\u2019 \u2192 \u2018recognition\u2019 \u2192 \u2018general\u2019 (as illustrated in fig. 6) and choose from the list of available OCR models (\u2018line recognition models\u2019 \u2013 \u2018available\u2019).</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="Abb7-2.png"></p><p>fig. 7. Selection of an appropriate OCR model.</p><p>Although it is generally possible to choose more than one recognition model, this is only recommended if the scans in question contain more than one printing type.</p><p>Finally, start the \u2018process flow\u2019 by clicking on \u2018execute\u2019. The current stage of this automated processing is translated into the progress bars and can be reviewed at any time. After the workflow\u2019s completion, the results can be verified under the menu item \u2018ground truth production\u2019 (\u2630) .</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="Abb7.png"></p><p>fig. 8. Individual lines with their corresponding OCR results.</p><p>If the OCR\u2019s line-based results immediately meet the desired or required accuracy of recognition, final results can be generated (TXT and/or PageXML) under menu item \u2018result generation\u2019. Were those results not to meet the user\u2019s requirements, they can be once more corrected before the final generation (see chapter 4.8).</p><p>Aside this \u2018process flow\u2019, OCR4all additionally provides the option of a sequential workflow which enables the user to independently execute the software\u2019s individual submodules (see fig. 1) and their components, thus ensuring the proper correctness and quality of the generated data. Considering that these submodules are built on one another, the sequential workflow seems to be the most adequate choice when working with early modern prints and their intricate, complex layout.</p><p>We recommend first-time users execute the sequential workflow at least once (as described below) in order to understand the submodules\u2019 operating principles.</p><h3 id="_4-2preprocessing" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-2preprocessing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4.2 Preprocessing</h3><p><strong>Input:</strong> original image (in colour, greyscale or binarized) <strong>Output:</strong> straightened binarized or greyscale image</p><ul><li>This processing step is meant to produce binarized and normalized greyscale images, a basic requirement for a successful segmentation and recognition.</li><li>Proceed by selecting the relevant scans (sidebar on the right) \u2013 the settings must remain unchanged (\u2018settings (general)\u2019 and \u2018settings (advanced)\u2019), meaning that the images\u2019 angle as well as the automatically generated number of CPUs used by this particular submodule don\u2019t vary either (the latter pertains to all of OCR4all\u2019s subsequent submodules).</li></ul><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="Abb9.png"></p><p>Abb. 9: fig. 9.

The progression of this work stage can be tracked on the console, more accurately the \u2018console output\u2019. Warnings might be issued during the binarization process (in \u2018console error\u2019) which have no incidence on the binarization results.</li><li>In order to check the binarization\u2019s success, simply go to \u2018project overview\u2019 and click on any page identifier then on the display option \u2018binary\u2019. In addition, all processed pages should be marked with a green check mark in the project overview.</li></ul><h3 id="_4-3noise-removal" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-3noise-removal" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4.3 Noise Removal</h3><p><strong>Input:</strong> polluted binarized images<br><strong>Output:</strong> binarized images without (or with very little) pollution</p><p>-The noise removal option helps to get rid of small impurities such as stains or blotches on the scans</p><ul><li>Proceed by clicking on \u2018noise removal\u2019 (main menu) and selecting the scans you wish to process on the right side of your display. You should initially conserve the default settings and, after clicking on \u2018execute\u2019, check the initial quality of the results: simply click on the designation of the scan you wish to verify (right sidebar); the \u2018image preview\u2019 option will provide you with a side by side comparison of the image before and after the noise removal. Please note that red elements will be deleted by this step.</li></ul><p><img src="'+s+'" alt="Abb10.png"></p><p>fig. 10.

LAREX is based on the basic assumption that the pages of early modern prints are composed of a recurring array of layout elements whose composition, although always book-specific, is largely consistent. Thus, the user is provided with different tools and resources whose aim it is to adequately structure and segment a printed page in order to catalogue all layout-related information necessary to the workflow\u2019s subsequent steps. Besides the basic distinction between text and non-text (e.g. text vs. image/woodcut) and its further specifications (e.g. text headline, main text, page number etc.), this also includes information about the page\u2019s reading order, i.e. the reading and usage order of the available layout elements.</p><h4 id="_4-4-1initial-settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-4-1initial-settings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4.4.1 Initial Settings</h4><ul><li>Menu: click on \u2018segmentation\u2019, then on \u2018LAREX\u2019</li><li>Go to \u2018Segmentation image type\u2019: select \u2018binary\u2019 if you will be working with binarized images, or \u2018despeckled\u2019 if the images went through the noise removal process</li><li>Click on \u2018open LAREX\u2019 \u2192 LAREX will open in a new tab</li></ul><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Abb11.png"></p><p>Abb. 11: LAREX settings.</p><p>Once LAREX has opened, the first one of the pre-selected pages will be visible at the centre of your display, including a few initial segmentation results, which are generated by the automatic segmentation each page undergoes when initially opened with LAREX. Please note that these results are not saved.

However, these can also be adjusted with your mouse and/or touchpad: shift the displayed page by left click-and-holding and moving your mouse; zoom using mouse wheel or touchpad.</li><li><strong>Undo</strong> und <strong>Redo:</strong> Undo or redo last user action. Even common key combinations are possible (i.g. CTRL + Z for undo last action).</li><li><strong>Delete selected items:</strong> Delete currently selected region.</li><li><strong>RoI, Region, Segment, Order:</strong> In addition to the right sidebar, these are the different options for processing and segmenting scans. While the options featured in the toolbar generally pertain to the current scan\u2019s processing (see below), the right sidebar features project-wide options across all scans.</li></ul><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="Abb14.png"></p><p>fig. 15. Right sidebar\u2019s settings.</p><p>However, the latter can be amended, changed or adjusted at any time. In this case, we recommend saving all previously carried-out settings, whether they be related to recognition parameters (\u2018parameters\u2019) or to document-specific layout elements (\u2018regions\u2019) previously determined by the user, in \u2018settings\u2019. This will ensure these particular settings are applied the next time you work with this tool, enabling you to work with document-specific settings from then on.</p><h4 id="_4-4-3specific-settings-regions-parameters-reading-order-settings" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-4-3specific-settings-regions-parameters-reading-order-settings" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4.4.3 Specific settings: \u2018regions\u2019, \u2018parameters\u2019, \u2018reading order\u2019, \u2018settings\u2019</h4><ul><li>&#39;<strong>Regions</strong>&#39;: In accordance with the LAREX concept, each scan (that is, each book page) is composed of several, distinct layout elements, e.g. main text (\u2018paragraph\u2019), title, marginalia, page number, etc. Thus, LAREX requires that corresponding \u2018regions\u2019 be assigned to each of these layout elements. This assigning task must be consistently performed throughout the entire work, in preparation for further steps as well as for the actual recognition of the displayed content! Besides a small number of pre-set and predefined layout regions \u2013 for instance \u2018image\u2019 (graphics such as woodcuts and ornate initials), \u2018paragraph\u2019 (main text) or \u2018page_number\u2019 \u2013 the user can define and add further book-specific layout regions under \u2018create\u2019. Not only can the user change a region\u2019s colour, but they can also define the minimum size of a textual/graphical page element which they wish to recognize as such (under \u2018minSize\u2019). The layout region thus defined can be added to the book-specific list by clicking on \u2018save\u2019.</li></ul><p><img src="'+h+'" alt="Abb15.png"></p><p>fig. 16.

In this case, manually verifying and correcting these layout elements afterwards is the more practical approach. If the user needs to delete a layout region\u2019s position, they can simply select the region in question and press the \u2018delete\u2019 key.</p><ul><li>&#39;<strong>Parameters</strong>&#39;: Allows to define overall parameters of image and text recognition. Taking the time to pre-set certain book-specific parameters is recommended when working with an inconsistent layout, particularly that of early modern prints. These often feature great divergences of word and line spacing. To avoid a narrowly spaced group of lines from being recognised as one cohesive textual element, the \u2018text dilation\u2019 feature enables you to control and define the text\u2019s degree of dilation in the x- and y-direction. This will enable the software to recognise originally too close word/line spacing or to recognise widely spaced passages as one cohesive element. We recommend trying and testing in order to find the settings best suited to a particular book.</li></ul><p><img src="'+m+'" alt="Abb18.png"></p><p>fig. 19.
