Workflow</h2><p>In general, OCR4all provides two different versions of an OCR workflow. They are widely different, particularly when it comes to the workload they require and, inevitably, the verifiability of partial outcomes and subsequent quality of the generated data. Both will be outlined and categorized in the following.</p><h3 id="_4-1process-flow" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_4-1process-flow" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 4.1 Process Flow</h3><p>This variant (main menu \u2630 \u2192 Process Flow) allows for a virtually automated workflow. It merely requires the initial pick of the intended scans (sidebar on the right) and subsequent selection of the individual processing steps the user wishes to apply to the chosen data (fig. 5).</p><pre>

Simply go to \u2018setting\u2019 \u2192 \u2018recognition\u2019 \u2192 \u2018general\u2019 (as illustrated in fig. 6) and choose from the list of available OCR models (\u2018line recognition models\u2019 \u2013 \u2018available\u2019).</p><pre>

</pre><p>fig. 7. Selection of an appropriate OCR model.</p><p>Although it is generally possible to choose more than one recognition model, this is only recommended if the scans in question contain more than one printing type.</p><p>Finally, start the \u2018process flow\u2019 by clicking on \u2018execute\u2019. The current stage of this automated processing is translated into the progress bars and can be reviewed at any time. After the workflow\u2019s completion, the results can be verified under the menu item \u2018ground truth production\u2019 (\u2630) .</p><pre>

Individual lines with their corresponding OCR results.</p><p>If the OCR\u2019s line-based results immediately meet the desired or required accuracy of recognition, final results can be generated (TXT and/or PageXML) under menu item \u2018result generation\u2019. Were those results not to meet the user\u2019s requirements, they can be once more corrected before the final generation (see chapter 4.8).</p><p>Aside this \u2018process flow\u2019, OCR4all additionally provides the option of a sequential workflow which enables the user to independently execute the software\u2019s individual submodules (see fig. 1) and their components, thus ensuring the proper correctness and quality of the generated data. Considering that these submodules are built on one another, the sequential workflow seems to be the most adequate choice when working with early modern prints and their intricate, complex layout.</p><p>We recommend first-time users execute the sequential workflow at least once (as described below) in order to understand the submodules\u2019 operating principles.</p>`,16);function n(i,s){return r}var l=e(o,[["render",n],["__file","4.001-Process_Flow.html.vue"]]);export{l as default};
